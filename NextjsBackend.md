## Small define for Nextjs and Nodejs

both of Next.js and Node.js can be primarily classified as Frameworks (Full Stack) tools.

- **NextJS :** A small framework for server-rendered universal JavaScript apps, it is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.

- **Node.js :** A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

### Local storage VS Cookies?

![Local storage VS Cookies](https://res.cloudinary.com/academind-gmbh/image/upload//v1/academind.com/content/tutorials/localstorage-vs-cookies-xss/localstorage-vs-cookies-xss)

1. **Storage Limit**
   - local Storage stores up to 10 megabytes
   - cookies provide a very restrictive and small storage capacity of 4 kilobytes.
2. **Accessibility**
   - local Storage could be accessed in any window or tab open on the browser for a website.
   - cookies are somewhat similar to local storage as they are accessible from any window or tab.
     Cookies could also be accessed on the server. Whenever we request the back-end server, all the cookies are also sent along. So they are also used for tasks related to authentication.
3. **Expiration**
   - Local Storage data never expires until you manually remove it, so in that sense, it could be very useful.
   - Cookies we can manually set the expiration date for them.
