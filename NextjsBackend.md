## Small define for Nextjs and Nodejs

both of Next.js and Node.js can be primarily classified as Frameworks (Full Stack) tools.

- **NextJS :** A small framework for server-rendered universal JavaScript apps, it is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.

- **Node.js :** A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
